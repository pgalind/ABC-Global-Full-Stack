Developed by Pablo Galindo

In this personal project I have developed a professional website for ABC Global Consulting utlizing the tecniques and best practices included in the book "Full Stack Web Development For Beginners" by Riaz Ahmed. Source code and additional material such as images used in the website are also provided in the book.
